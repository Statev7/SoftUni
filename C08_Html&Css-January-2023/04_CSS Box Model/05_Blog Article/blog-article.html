        <h2>4 Ways to Remove Unused CSS</h2>

        <p>CSS files can easily gain redundant KBs over time. It may happen due to leftovers from historic stylings or
            simply because youâ€™ve used a large CSS framework like Bootstrap (147 KB when minimized) and most probably
            have used only a fraction of
            what it has to offer. Unused CSS slows down page loading and makes maintenance much more difficult than it
            has to.
